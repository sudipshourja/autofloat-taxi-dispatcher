### Why Choose AutoFlot?

1. **Fair Pricing Model**
   Stop paying endless commission cuts. Pay a predictable subscription fee and keep more of your earnings. Your subscription fee is only activated after you reach a certain number of rides. Until then, it’s free. Predictable, affordable, and built for your growth.

2. **Flexible Fare Control**
   Each taxi park sets its own per-kilometer rates. Different drivers and cars can have different fares, fully controlled by you – no central restrictions.

3. **Your Brand, Your Customers**
   AutoFlot allows taxi parks to promote their own brand inside the passenger app. Build loyalty and stay visible to your riders.

### Passenger Choice

Passengers using the **Navidi App** can see rides from all registered taxi parks, compare fares, and choose the one that suits them best.
